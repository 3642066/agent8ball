Some quick notes on naming conventions for javascript:

CASING
Use camel casing (camelCasing) for all members and pascal casing (PascalCasing)
for classes.

MEMBERS

* Private members: append an m_ in front of the name (m_name)
* Static members: append an s_ in from the name (s_name)
* Public methods: standard camel cased name (name)
* Private methods: append a _ in front of the name (_name)

CONSTANTS

* Constants should be treated as static so they use the s_ (s_name). Additionally,
  they should be declared with @const in the comments

ENUMS

* Use all caps for the key name (e.g. EventType = { FOO: 'foo', BAR: 'bar} )
